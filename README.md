This assignment is meant to review the Model-View-Controller (MVC) method previously learned in N215. For this, I decided to go for a fun little desert theme. All of the images are not my own, rather ones found on the internet as open-sourced wallpapers. I had some fun making this assignment, even if I found myself in a design-block for almost all of it.
